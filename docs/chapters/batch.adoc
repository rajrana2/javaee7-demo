== Ticket Sales (Batch Applications for the Java Platform)

*Purpose*: Read the total sales for each show and populate the database.
In doing so several new features of Java API for Batch Processing 1.0
will be introduced and demonstrated by using them in the application.

*Estimated Time*: 30-45 mins

Batch Processing is execution of series of `jobs' that is suitable for
non-interactive, bulk-oriented and long-running tasks. Batch
Applications for the Java Platform (JSR 352) will define a programming
model for batch applications and a runtime for scheduling and executing
jobs.

The core concepts of Batch Processing are:

* A *Job* is an instance that encapsulates an entire batch process. A
job is typically put together using a Job Specification Language and
consists of multiple steps. The Job Specification Language for JSR 352
is implemented with XML and is referred as `Job XML'.
* A *Step* is a domain object that encapsulates an independent,
sequential phase of a job. A step contains all of the information
necessary to define and control the actual batch processing.
* *JobOperator* provides an interface to manage all aspects of job
processing, including operational commands, such as start, restart, and
stop, as well as job repository commands, such as retrieval of job and
step executions.
* *JobRepository* holds information about jobs current running and jobs
that run in the past. JobOperator provides access to this repository.
* Reader-Processor-Writer pattern is the primary pattern and is called
as *Chunk-oriented** **Processing*. In this, *ItemReader* reads one item
at a time, *ItemProcessor* processes the item based upon the business
logic, such as calculate account balance and hands it
to *ItemWriter* for aggregation. Once the 'chunk' numbers of items are
aggregated, they are written out, and the transaction is committed.

This section will read the cumulative sales for each show from a CSV
file and populate them in a database.

. Right-click on Source Packages, select `New', `Java Package',
specify the value as `org.javaee7.movieplex7.batch', and click on
`Finish'.
+
. Right-click on newly created package, select `New', `Java Class',
specify the name as `SalesReader'. Make this class extend from
`AbstractItemReader' by changing the class definition and add:
+
[source, java]
extends AbstractItemReader
+
`AbstractItemReader` is an abstract class that implements `ItemReader`
interface. The `ItemReader` interface defines methods that read a stream
of items for chunk processing. This reader implementation returns a
String item type as indicated in the class definition.
+
Add `@Named` as a class-level annotations and it allows the bean to be
injected in Job XML. Add `@Dependent` as another class-level annotation to
mark this bean as a bean defining annotation so that this bean is
available for injection.
+
Resolve the imports.
+
. Override `open()` method to initialize the reader by adding the following code:
+
[source, java]
----
private BufferedReader reader;

public void open(Serializable checkpoint) throws Exception {
    reader = new BufferedReader(
        new InputStreamReader(
        Thread.currentThread()
            .getContextClassLoader()
            .getResourceAsStream("META-INF/sales.csv")));
}
----
+
This method initializes a BufferedReader from `META-INF/sales.csv' that
is bundled with the application.
+
Sampling of the first few lines from `sales.csv' is shown below:
+
[source,csv]
1,500.00
2,660.00
3,80.00
4,470.00
5,1100.x0
+
Each line has a show identifier comma separated by the total sales for
that show. Note that the last line (5^th^ record in the sample) has an
intentional typo. In addition, 17^th^ record also has an additional
typo. The lab will use these lines to demonstrate how to handle parsing
errors.
+
. Override the following method from the abstract class:
+
[source,java]
----
@Override
public String readItem() {
    String string = null;
    try {
        string = reader.readLine();
    } catch (IOException ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }
    return string;
}
----
+
The `readItem` method returns the next item from the stream. It returns
`null` to indicate end of stream. Note end of stream indicates end of chunk,
so the current chunk will be committed and the step will end.
+
Resolve the imports.
+
. Right-click on `org.javaee7.movieplex7.batch' package, select
`New', `Java Class', specify the name as `SalesProcessor'. Change the
class definition and add:
+
[source, java]
implements ItemProcessor
+
`ItemProcessor` is an interface that defines a method that is used to
operate on an input item and produce an output item. This processor
accepts a String input item from the reader, `SalesReader` in our case,
and returns a `Sales` instance to the writer (coming shortly). `Sales` is
the pre-packaged JPA entity with the application starter source code.
+
Add `@Named` and `@Dependent` as class-level annotations so that it allows
the bean to be injected in Job XML.
+
Resolve the imports.
+
. Add implementation of the abstract method from the interface as:
+
[source,java]
----
@Override
public Sales processItem(Object s) {
    Sales sales = new Sales();
    StringTokenizer tokens = new StringTokenizer((String)s, ",");
    sales.setId(Integer.parseInt(tokens.nextToken()));
    sales.setAmount(Float.parseFloat(tokens.nextToken()));

    return sales;
}
----
+
This method takes a `String` parameter coming from the `SalesReader`, parses
the value, populates them in the `Sales` instance, and returns it. This is
then aggregated with the writer.
+
The method can return null indicating that the item should not be
aggregated. For example, the parsing errors can be handled within the
method and return null if the values are not correct. However this
method is implemented where any parsing errors are thrown as exception.
Job XML can be instructed to skip these exceptions and thus that
particular record is skipped from aggregation as well (shown later).
+
Resolve the imports.
+
. Right-click on `org.javaee7.movieplex7.batch` package, select
`New', `Java Class', specify the name as `SalesWriter'. Change the
class definition and add:
+
[source, java]
extends AbstractItemWriter
+
`AbstractItemWriter` is an abstract class that implements `ItemWriter`
interface. The ItemWriter interface defines methods that write to a
stream of items for chunk processing. This writer writes a list of `Sales`
items.
+
Add `@Named` and `@Dependent` as class-level annotations so that it allows
the bean to be injected in Job XML.
+
Resolve the imports.
+
. Inject `EntityManager` as:
+
[source, java]
@PersistenceContext EntityManager em;
+
Override `writeItems` method from the abstract class by adding the following code:
+
[source, java]
----
@Override
@Transactional
public void writeItems(List list) {
    for (Sales s : (List<Sales>)list) {
        em.persist(s);
    }
}
----
+
Batch runtime aggregates the list of `Sales` instances returned from the
`SalesProessor` and makes it available as List in this method. This method
iterates over the list and persist each item in the database.
+
The method also specifies `@Transactional` as a method level annotation.
This is a new annotation introduced by JTA 1.2 that provides the ability
to control transaction boundaries on CDI managed beans. This provides
the semantics of EJB transaction attributes in CDI beans without
dependencies such as RMI. This support is implemented via an
implementation of a CDI interceptor that conducts the necessary
suspending, resuming, etc. 
+
In this case, a transaction is automatically started before the method
is called, committed if no checked exceptions are thrown, and rolled
back if runtime exceptions are thrown. This behavior can be overridden
using `rollbackOn` and `dontRollbackOn` attributes of the annotation.
+
[NOTE]
=================
Each chunk is processed within a container-managed transaction already.
There is really no need for `@Transactional` on `writeItems` method but 
shows a usage for the annotation.
=================
Resolve the imports.
+
. Create Job XML that defines the job, step, and chunk.
+
In `Files' tab, expand the project -> `src' -> `main' -> `resources',
right-click on `META-INF', select `New', `Folder', specify
the name as `batch-jobs', and click on `Finish'.
+
Right-click on the newly created folder, select `New', `Other', select
`XML', `XML Document', click on `Next >', give the name as `eod-sales',
click on `Next', take the default, and click on `Finish'.
+
Replace contents of the file with the following:
+
[source, xml]
----
<job id="endOfDaySales"
    xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee"
    version="1.0">
    <step id="populateSales">
        <chunk item-count="3" skip-limit="5">
            <reader ref="salesReader"/>
            <processor ref="salesProcessor"/>
            <writer ref="salesWriter"/>
            <skippable-exception-classes>
                <include class="java.lang.NumberFormatException"/>
            </skippable-exception-classes>
        </chunk>
    </step>
</job>
----
+
This code shows that the job has one step of chunk type. The `<reader>`,
`<processor>`, and `<writer>` elements define the CDI bean name of the
implementations of `ItemReader`, `ItemProcessor`, and `ItemWriter` interfaces.
The `item-count` attribute defines that 3 items are
read/processed/aggregated and then given to the writer. The entire
reader/processor/writer cycle is executed within a transaction.
+
The `<skippable-exception-classes>` element specifies a set of exceptions to
be skipped by chunk processing.
+
CSV file used for this lab has intentionally introduced couple of typos
that would generate `NumberFormatException`. Specifying this element
allows skipping the exception, ignore that particular element, and
continue processing. If this element is not specified then the batch
processing will halt. The `skip-limit` attribute specifies the number of
exceptions a step will skip.
+
. Lets invoke the batch job.
+
In `Projects' tab, right-click on `org.javaee7.movieplex7.batch' package, select `New',
`Java Class'. Enter the name as `SalesBean' and click on `Finish'
button.
+
Add the following code to the bean:
+
[source, java]
----
public void runJob() {
    try {
        JobOperator jo = BatchRuntime.getJobOperator();
        long jobId = jo.start("eod-sales", new Properties());
        System.out.println("Started job: with id: " + jobId);
    } catch (JobStartException ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }
}
----
+
This method uses `BatchRuntime` to get an instance of `JobOperator`, which
is then used to start the job. `JobOperator` is the interface for
operating on batch jobs. It can be used to start, stop, and restart
jobs. It can additionally inspect job history, to discover what jobs are
currently running and what jobs have previously run.
+
Add `@Named` and `@RequestScoped` as class-level annotations. This allows
the bean to be injectable in an EL expression.
+
Resolve the imports.
+
image::5.10-imports.png[title="RequestScoped import"]
+
. Inject `EntityManagerFactory` in the class as:
+
[source, java]
@PersistenceUnit EntityManagerFactory emf;
+
and add the following method:
+
[source, java]
----
public List<Sales> getSalesData() {
    return emf.
        createEntityManager().
        createNamedQuery("Sales.findAll", Sales.class).
        getResultList();
}
----
+
This method uses a pre-defined `@NamedQuery` to query the database and
return all the rows from the table.
+
Resolve the imports.
+
. Right-click on `Web Pages', select `New', `Folder', specify the
name as `batch', and click on `Finish'.
+
Right-click on the newly created folder, select `New', `Other',
`JavaServer Faces', `Facelets Template Client', and click on `Next >'.
+
Give the File Name as `sales'. Click on `Browse' next to `Template:',
expand `Web Pages', `WEB-INF', select `template.xhtml', and click on
`Select File'. Click on `Finish'.
+
In this file, remove `<ui:define>` sections where name attribute value is
`top' and `left'. These sections are inherited from the template.
+
Replace `<ui:define>` section with `content' name such that it looks like:
+
[source, xml]
----
<ui:composition template="../WEB-INF/template.xhtml">
    <ui:define name="content">
        <h1>Movie Sales</h1>
        <h:form>
            <h:dataTable value="#{salesBean.salesData}" var="s" border="1">
                <h:column>
                    <f:facet name="header">
                        <h:outputText value="Show ID" />
                    </f:facet>
                    #{s.id}
                </h:column>
                <h:column>
                    <f:facet name="header">
                        <h:outputText value="Sales" />
                    </f:facet>
                    #{s.amount}
                </h:column>
            </h:dataTable>
            <h:commandButton
                value="Run Job"
                action="sales"
                actionListener="#{salesBean.runJob()}"/>
            <h:commandButton
                value="Refresh"
                action="sales" />
        </h:form>
    </ui:define>
</ui:composition>
----
+
This code displays the show identifier and sales from that show in a
table by invoking `SalesBean.getSalesData()`. First command button allows
invoking the job that processes the CSV file and populates the database.
The second command button refreshes the page.
+
Right-click on the yellow bulb to fix namespace prefix/URI mapping for `h:`. This
needs to be repeated for `f:` prefix.
+
. Add the following code in `template.xhtml` along with other <outputLink>s:
+
[source, xml]
----
<p/><h:outputLink
    value="${facesContext.externalContext.requestContextPath}/faces/batch/sales.xhtml">
    Sales
    </h:outputLink>
----
+
. Run the project to see the output as shown.
+
image::5.14-sales.png[title="Sales link on main page"]
+
Notice, a new `Sales' entry is displayed in the left navigation bar.
+
. Click on `Sales' to see the output as shown.
+
image::5.15-sales.png[title="Movie Sales page"]
+
The empty table indicates that there is no sales data in the database.
+
. Click on `Run Job' button to initiate data processing of CSV
file. Look for `Waiting for localhost' in the browser status bar,
wait for a couple of seconds for the processing to finish, and then
click on `Refresh' button to see the updated output as shown.
+
image::5.16-sales-output.png[title="Movie Sales output page"]
+
Now the table is populated with the sales data.
+
Note that record 5 is missing from the table, as this records did not
have correct numeric entries for the sales total. The Job XML for the
application explicitly mentioned to skip such errors.
