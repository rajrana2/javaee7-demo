== Movie Points (Java Message Service)

*Purpose*: Customers accrue points for watching a movie.

*Estimated Time*: 30-45 mins

Java Message Service 2.0 allows sending and receiving messages between
distributed systems. JMS 2 introduced several improvements over the
previous version such as:

* New `JMSContext` interface
* AutoCloseable `JMSContext`, `Connection`, and `Session`
* Use of runtime exceptions
* Method chaining on `JMSProducer`
* Simplified message sending

This section will provide a page to simulate submission of movie points
accrued by a customer. These points are submitted to a JMS queue that is
then read synchronously by another bean. JMS queue for further
processing, possibly storing in the database using JPA.

. Right-click on Source Packages, select `New', `Java Class',
specify the name as `SendPointsBean', package as `org.javaee7.movieplex7.points',
and click on `Finish'.
+
Add the following class-level annotations:
+
[source, java]
----
@Named
@RequestScoped
----
+
This makes the bean to be EL-injectable and automatically activated and
passivated with the request.
+
Resolve the imports.
+

+
. A message to a JMS Queue is sent after the customer has bought the
tickets. Another bean will then retrieve this message and update the
points for that customer. This allows the two systems, one generating
the data about tickets purchased and the other about crediting the
account with the points, completely decoupled.
+
This lab will mimic the sending and consuming of a message by an
explicit call to the bean from a JSF page.
+
Add the following field to the class:
+
[source, java]
----
@NotNull
@Pattern(regexp = "^\\d{2},\\d{2}",
         message = "Message format must be 2 digits, comma, 2 digits, e.g.12,12")
private String message;
----
+
This field contains the message sent to the queue. This field’s value is
bound to an inputText in a JSF page (created later). Constraints have
been specified on this bean that enable validation of data on form
submit. It requires the data to consists of two numerical digits, followed
by a comma, and then two more numerical digits. If the message does not
meet the validation criteria then the error message to be displayed is
specified using message attribute.
+
This could be thought as conveying the customer identifier and the
points accrued by that customer.
+
Generate getter/setters for this field. Right-click in the editor pane,
select `Insert Code' (kbd:[Ctrl+I] shortcut on OSX), select `Getter and
Setter', select the field, and click on `Generate'.
+
. Add the following code to the class:
+
[source, java]
----
@Inject
JMSContext context;

@Resource(lookup = "java:global/jms/pointsQueue")
Queue pointsQueue;

public void sendMessage() {
    System.out.println("Sending message: " + message);
    context.createProducer().send(pointsQueue, message);
}
----
+
The Java EE Platform requires a pre-configured JMS connection factory
under the JNDI name `java:comp/DefaultJMSConnectionFactory`. If no
connection factory is specified then the pre-configured connection
factory is used. In a Java EE environment, where CDI is enabled by
default anyway, a container-managed `JMSContext` can be injected as:
+
[source, java]
----
@Inject
JMSContext context;
----
+
This code uses the default factory to inject an instance of
container-managed `JMSContext`.
+
`JMSContext` is a new interface introduced in JMS 2. This combines in a
single object the functionality of two separate objects from the JMS 1.1
API: a `Connection` and a `Session`.
+
When an application needs to send messages it use the `createProducer`
method to create a `JMSProducer` that provides methods to configure and
send messages. Messages may be sent either synchronously or
asynchronously.
+
When an application needs to receive messages it uses one of several
`createConsumer` or `createDurableConsumer` methods to create a `JMSConsumer`.
A `JMSConsumer` provides methods to receive messages either synchronously
or asynchronously.
+
All messages are then sent to a `Queue` instance (created later)
identified by `java:global/jms/pointsQueue` JNDI name. The actual message
is obtained from the value entered in the JSF page and bound to the
message field.
+
Resolve the imports.
+
WARNING: Make sure `Queue` class is imported from `javax.jms.Queue` instead of the
default `java.util.Queue`.
+
Click on `OK'.
+
. Right-click on `org.javaee7.movieplex7.points' package, select
`New', `Java Class', specify the name as `ReceivePointsBean'.
+
Add the following class-level annotations:
+
[source, java]
----
@JMSDestinationDefinition(name = "java:global/jms/pointsQueue",
interfaceName = "javax.jms.Queue")
@Named
@RequestScoped
----
+
This allows the bean to refered from an EL expression. It also activates
and passivates the bean with the request.
+
`JMSDestinationDefinition` is a new annotation introduced in JMS 2. It is
used by the application to provision the required resources and allow an
application to be deployed into a Java EE environment with minimal
administrative configuration. This code will create Queue with the JNDI
name `java:global/jms/pointsQueue`.
+
. Add the following code to the class:
+
[source, java]
----
@Inject
JMSContext context;

@Resource(lookup="java:global/jms/pointsQueue")
Queue pointsQueue;

public String receiveMessage() {
    try (JMSConsumer consumer = context.createConsumer(pointsQueue)) {
        String message = consumer.receiveBody(String.class);
        System.out.println("Received message: " + message);
        return message;
    }
}
----
+
This code creates `JMSConsumer` in a try-with-resources block
which is then used to synchronously receive a message. Note that `JMSConsumer`
is created as an auto-managed resource and so is closed automatically after
receiving each message. Alternatively asynchronous message delivery can also be setup
using Message Driven Beans. However that is not covered in this lab.
+
. Add the following method to the class:
+
[source, java]
----
public int getQueueSize() {
    int count = 0;
    try {
        QueueBrowser browser = context.createBrowser(pointsQueue);
        Enumeration elems = browser.getEnumeration();
        while (elems.hasMoreElements()) {
            elems.nextElement();
            count++;
        }
    } catch (JMSException ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }
    return count;
}
----
+
This code creates a `QueueBrowser` to look at the messages on a queue
without removing them. It calculates and returns the total number of
messages in the queue.
+
Make sure to resolve the import from `javax.jms.Queue`, take all other
defaults.
+
. Right-click on `Web Pages', select `New', `Folder', specify the
name as `points', and click on `Finish'.
+
In `Web Pages', right-click on newly created folder, select `Facelets
Template Client', give the File Name as `points'. Click on `Browse'
next to `Template:', expand `Web Pages', `WEB-INF', select
`template.xhtml', and click on `Select File'. Click on `Finish'.
+
. In this file, remove `<ui:define>` sections where name attribute value is
`top' and `left'. These sections are inherited from the template.
+
Replace the `<ui:define>` section with `content' name such that it looks like:
+
[source, xml]
----
<ui:composition template="../WEB-INF/template.xhtml">
    <ui:define name="content">
        <h1>Points</h1>
        <h:form>
        Queue size:
            <h:outputText value="#{receivePointsBean.queueSize}"/><p/>
            <h:inputText value="#{sendPointsBean.message}"/>
            <h:commandButton
                value="Send Message"
                action="points"
                actionListener="#{sendPointsBean.sendMessage()}"/>
        </h:form>
        <h:form>
            <h:commandButton
                value="Receive Message"
                action="points"
                actionListener="#{receivePointsBean.receiveMessage()}"/>
        </h:form>
    </ui:define>
</ui:composition>
----
+
Click on the yellow bulb to resolve namespace prefix/URI mapping for `h:`
prefix.
+
This page displays the number of messages in the current queue. It
provides a text box for entering the message that can be sent to the
queue. The first command button invokes `sendMessage` method from
`SendPointsBean` and refreshes the page. Updated queue count, incremented
by 1 in this case, is displayed. The second command button invokes
`receiveMessage` method from `ReceivePointsBean` and refreshes the page. The
queue count is updated again, decremented by 1 in this case.
+
If the message does not meet the validation criteria then the error
message is displayed on the screen.
+
. Add the following code in `template.xhtml' along with other
<outputLink>s:
+
[source, xml]
----
<p/><h:outputLink
        value="${facesContext.externalContext.requestContextPath}/faces/points/points.xhtml">
        Points
    </h:outputLink>
----
+
. Run the project. The update page looks like as shown:
+
image::8.10-output.png[title="Points link on main page"]
+
Click on `Points' to see the output as:
+
image::8.10-output2.png[title="Points output page"]
+
The output shows that the queue has 0 messages. Enter a message `1212'
in the text box and click on `Send Message' to see the output as shown.
+
image::8.10-output3.png[title="Validation message on Points page"]
+
This message is not meeting the validation criteria and so the error
message is displayed.
+
Enter a message as `12,12' in the text box and click on `Send Message'
button to see the output as:
+
image::8.10-output4.png[title="Correct input for Points page - Send Message (queue size=1)"]
+
The updated count now shows that there is 1 message in the queue. Click
on `Receive Message' button to see output as:
+
image::8.10-output5.png[title="Correct input for Points page - Receive Message (queue size=0)"]
+
The updated count now shows that the message has been consumed and the
queue has 0 messages.
+
Click on `Send Message' 4 times to see the output as:
+
image::8.10-output6.png[title="Correct input for Points page - Send Message (queue size=4)"]
+
The updated count now shows that the queue has 4 messages. Click on
`Receive Message' 2 times to see the output as:
+
image::8.10-output7.png[title="Correct input for Points page - Receive Message (queue size=2)"]
+
The count is once again updated to reflect the 2 consumed and 2
remaining messages in the queue.
