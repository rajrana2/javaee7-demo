== Troubleshooting

[qanda]
How can I start/stop/restart the application server from within the IDE ?::
In the `Services' tab, right-click on
ifdef::server-glassfish[]
`GlassFish Server 4'.
endif::server-glassfish[]
ifdef::server-wildfly[]
`WildFly 8'.
endif::server-wildfly[]
All the commands to start, stop, and restart are available from the pop-up menu.

I accidentally closed the output log window. How do I bring it back ?::
In “Services” tab of NetBeans, expand `Servers', choose the application server
node, and select
ifdef::server-glassfish[]
`View Domain Server Log'.

In addition, the web-based administration console can be seen by clicking on
ifdef::server-glassfish[]
`View Domain Admin Console'.
endif::server-glassfish[]
ifdef::server-wildfly[]
`View Admin Console'.
endif::server-wildfly[]
