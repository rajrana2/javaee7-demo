== Add Movie (Java API for JSON Processing)

*Purpose*: Add a new movie. In doing so several new features of the Java
API for JSON Processing 1.0 will be introduced and demonstrated by using
them in the application.

*Estimated Time*: 30-45 mins

Java API for JSON Processing provides a standard API to parse and
generate JSON so that the applications can rely upon a portable API.
This API will provide:

* Produce/Consume JSON in a streaming fashion (similar to StAX API for XML)
* Build a Java Object Model for JSON (similar to DOM API for XML)

This section will define a JAX-RS Entity Providers that will allow
reading and writing JSON for a Movie POJO. The JAX-RS Client API will
request this JSON representation.

JAX-RS Entity Providers supply mapping services between on-the-wire
representations and their associated Java types. Â Several standard Java
types such as `String`, `byte[]`, `javax.xml.bind.JAXBElement`,
`java.io.InputStream`, `java.io.File`, and others have a pre-defined mapping
and is required by the specification. Applications may provide their own
mapping to custom types using `MessageBodyReader` and `MessageBodyWriter`
interfaces.

This section will provide the ability to add a new movie to the
application. Typically, this functionality will be available after
proper authentication and authorization.

. Right-click on Source Packages, select `New', `Java Class',
specify the name as `MovieReader', package as `org.javaee7.movieplex7.json'
and click on `Finish'. Add the following class-level annotations:
+
. Right-click on newly created package, select `New', `Java Class',
specify the name as `MovieReader', and click on `Finish'. Add the
following class-level annotations:
+
[source, java]
----
@Provider
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
----
+
`@Provider` allows this implementation to be discovered by the JAX-RS
runtime during the provider scanning phase. `@Consumes` indicates that
this implementation will consume a JSON representation of the resource.
+
Make sure to resolve imports from the appropriate package as shown.

. Make the class implements `MessageBodyReader<Movie>`.
+
image::7.3-implements.png[title="Implement abstract methods for MessageBodyReader"]
+
Click on the hint (shown as yellow bulb) on the class definition and
select `Implement all abstract methods'.
+
. Change implementation of the `isReadable` method as:
+
[source, java]
return Movie.class.isAssignableFrom(type);
+
This method ascertains if the `MessageBodyReader` can produce an instance
of a particular type.
+
. Replace the `readFrom` method with:
+
[source, java]
----
@Override
public Movie readFrom(
    Class<Movie> type,
    Type type1,
    Annotation[] antns,
    MediaType mt,
    MultivaluedMap<String, String> mm,
    InputStream in)
      throws IOException, WebApplicationException {

    Movie movie = new Movie();
    JsonParser parser = Json.createParser(in);
    while (parser.hasNext()) {
        switch (parser.next()) {
            case KEY_NAME:
                String key = parser.getString();
                parser.next();
                switch (key) {
                    case "id":
                        movie.setId(parser.getInt());
                        break;
                    case "name":
                        movie.setName(parser.getString());
                        break;
                    case "actors":
                        movie.setActors(parser.getString());
                        break;
                    default:
                        break;
                }
                break;
            default:
                break;
        }
    }
    return movie;
}
----
+
This code reads a type from the input stream in. `JsonParser`, a streaming
parser, is created from the input stream. Key values are read from the
parser and a `Movie` instance is populated and returned.
+
Resolve the imports.
+
. Right-click on `org.javaee7.movieplex7.json' package, select `New', `Java Class',
specify the name as `MovieWriter', and click on `Finish'. Add the
following class-level annotations:
+
[source, java]
----
@Provider
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
----
+
`@Provider` allows this implementation to be discovered by the JAX-RS
runtime during the provider scanning phase. `@Produces` indicates that
this implementation will produce a JSON representation of the resource.
+
Resolve the imports as shown.
+
image::7.6-imports.png[title="Provider import"]
+
. Make this class implement `MessageBodyWriter` interface by adding the following code:
[source, java]
implements MessageBodyWriter<Movie>
+
Resolve the imports.
+
The IDE provide a hint to implement abstract methods as:
+
image::7.7-implements.png[title="Implement abstract methods for MessageBodyWriter"]
+
Click on the hint (show as yellow bulb) on the class definition and
select `Implement all abstract methods'.
+
. Change implementation of the `isWritable` method to:
+
[source, java]
return Movie.class.isAssignableFrom(type);
+
This method ascertains if the `MessageBodyWriter` supports a particular
type.
+
. Add implementation of the `getSize` method as:
+
[source, java]
return -1;
+
Originally, this method was called to ascertain the length in bytes of
the serialized form of `t`. In JAX-RS 2.0, this method is deprecated and
the value returned by the method is ignored by a JAX-RS runtime. All
`MessageBodyWriter` implementations are advised to return -1.
+
. Change implementation of the `writeTo` method to:
+
[source, java]
----
JsonGenerator gen = Json.createGenerator(entityStream);
gen.writeStartObject()
    .write("id", t.getId())
    .write("name", t.getName())
    .write("actors", t.getActors())
    .writeEnd();
    gen.flush();
----
+
This method writes a type to an HTTP message. `JsonGenerator` writes JSON
data to an output stream in a streaming way. Overloaded write methods
are used to write different data types to the stream.
+
Resolve the imports.
+
. In `Web Pages', right-click on `client' folder, select `New',
`Facelets Template Client'. Give the File Name as `addmovie'.
Click on `Browse' next to `Template:', expand `Web Pages',
`WEB-INF', select `template.xhtml', and click on `Select File'.
Click on `Finish'.
+
. In this file, remove `<ui:define>` sections where name attribute value is
`top' and `left'. These sections are inherited from the template.
+
Replace `<ui:define>` section with `content' name such that it looks like:
+
[source, xml]
----
<ui:composition template="../WEB-INF/template.xhtml">
    <ui:define name="content">
    <h1>Add a New Movie</h1>
    <h:form>
        <table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
            <tr>
                <th align="left">Movie Id:</th>
                <td><h:inputText value="#{movieBackingBean.movieId}"/></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th align="left">Movie Name:</th>
                <td><h:inputText value="#{movieBackingBean.movieName}"/> </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th align="left">Movie Actors:</th>
                <td><h:inputText value="#{movieBackingBean.actors}"/></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h:commandButton
            value="Add"
            action="movies"
            actionListener="#{movieClientBean.addMovie()}"/>
    </h:form>
    </ui:define>
</ui:composition>
----
+
This code creates a form to accept input of `id`, `name`, and `actors` of a
movie. These values are bound to fields in `MovieBackingBean`. The click
of command button invokes the addMovie method from `MovieClientBean` and
then renders `movies.xhtml'.
+
Click on the hint (show as yellow bulb) to resolve the namespace
prefix/URI mapping as shown.
+
image::7.11-imports.png[title="Namespace prefix mapping imports"]
+
. Add `movieName` and `actors` field to `MovieBackingBean` as:
+
[source, java]
----
String movieName;
String actors;
----
+
Generate getters and setters by clicking on the menu item `Source' and
then `Insert Code'.
+
. Add the following code to `movies.xhtml'
+
[source, xml]
<h:commandButton value="New Movie" action="addmovie" />
+
along with rest of the <commandButton>s.
+
. Add the following method in `MovieClientBean`:
+
[source, java]
----
public void addMovie() {
    Movie m = new Movie();
    m.setId(bean.getMovieId());
    m.setName(bean.getMovieName());
    m.setActors(bean.getActors());
    target
        .register(MovieWriter.class)
        .request()
        .post(Entity.entity(m, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON));
}
----
+
This method creates a new `Movie` instance, populates it with the values
from the backing bean, and POSTs the bean to the REST endpoint. The
register method registers a MovieWriter that provides conversion from
the POJO to JSON. Media type of `application/json` is specified using `MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON`.
+
Resolve the imports as shown
+
image::7.14-imports.png[title="Entity import"]
+
. Run the project to see the updated main page as:
+
image::7.15-output.png[title="New Movie button"]
+
A new movie can be added by clicking on `New Movie' button.
+
. Enter the details as shown:
+
image::7.16-output.png[title="Add a New Movie page"]
+
Click on `Add' button. The `Movie Id' value has to be greater than 20
otherwise the primary key constraint will be violated. The table
definition may be updated to generate the primary key based upon a
sequence; however this is not done in the application.
+
The updated page looks like as shown
+
image::7.16-output2.png[title="Newly added movie"]
+
Note that the newly added movie is now displayed.
