== Problem Statement

This hands-on lab builds a typical 3-tier Java EE 7 Web application that
allows customers to view the show timings for a movie in a 7-theater
Cineplex and make reservations. Users can add new movies and delete
existing movies. Customers can discuss the movie in a chat room. Total
sales from each showing are calculated at the end of the day. Customers
also accrue points for watching movies.

This figure shows the key components of the application. The User
Interface initiates all the flows in the application. Show Booking,
Add/Delete Movie and Ticket Sales interact with the database; Movie
Points may interact with the database, however, this is out of scope for
this application; and Chat Room does not interact with the database.

The different functions of the application, as detailed above, utilize
various Java technologies and web standards in their implementation. The
following figure shows how Java EE technologies are used in different
flows.

The table below details the components and the selected technology used
in its’ implementation.

[cols="2,8"]
|===
|Flow | Description

|User Interface
|Written entirely in _JavaServer Faces_ (JSF)

|Chat Room
|Utilizes client-side JavaScript and JSON to communicate with a _WebSocket_ endpoint

|Ticket Sales
|Uses _Batch Applications for the Java Platform_ to calculate the total
sales and persist to the database.

|Add/Delete Movie
|Implemented using RESTful Web Services. JSON is used as on-the-wire data format

|Movie Points
|Uses _Java Message Service_ (JMS) to update and obtain loyalty reward
points; an optional implementation using database technology may be
performed

|Show Booking
|Uses lightweight _Enterprise JavaBeans_ to communicate with the database
using Java Persistence API

This document is not a comprehensive tutorial of Java EE. The attendees
are expected to know the basic Java EE concepts such as EJB, JPA,
JAX-RS, and CDI. The http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/doc/[Java
EE 7 Tutorial] is a good place to learn all these concepts. However
enough explanation is provided in this guide to get you started with the
application.

WARNING: This is a sample application and the code may not be
following the best practices to prevent SQL injection, cross-side
scripting attacks, escaping parameters, and other similar features
expected of a robust enterprise application. This is intentional such as
to stay focused on explaining the technology. It is highly recommended
to make sure that the code copied from this sample application is
updated to meet those requirements.

=== Lab Flow

The attendees will start with an existing maven application and by
following the instructions and guidance provided by this lab they will:

* Read existing source code to gain an understanding of the structure of
the application and use of the selected platform technologies.
* Add new and update existing code with provided fragments in order to
demonstrate usage of different technology stacks in the Java EE 7
platform.

While you are copy/pasting the code from this document into NetBeans,
here are couple of tips that will be really useful and make your
experience enjoyable!

Source Code Formatting::
NetBeans provides capability to neatly format the source code
following conventions. This can be done for any type of source code,
whether its XML or Java or something else. It is highly recommended to
use this functionality after the code is copy/pasted from this document
to the editor. This keeps the code legible.

This functionality can be accessed by right-clicking in the editor pane
and selecting “Format” as shown.

This functionality is also accessible using the following keyboard
shortcuts:

|Shortcut | Operating System

|kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+F]
|OSX

|Windows

Automatic Imports::
Copy/pasting the Java code from this document in NetBeans editor does
not auto-import the classes. This is required to be done manually in
order for the classes to compile. This can be fixed for each missing
import statement by clicking on the yellow bulb shown in the side bar.

Alternatively all the imports can be resolved by right-clicking on the
editor pane and selecting ``Fix Imports'' as shown.

The defaults may work in most of the cases. Choices are shown in case a
class is available to import from multiple packages. If multiple
packages are available then specific packages to import from are clearly
marked in the document.

=== Estimated Time

Following the complete instructions in this document can take any where
from two to four hours. The wide time range accommodates for learning
the new technologies, finding your way in NetBeans, copy/pasting the
code, and debugging the errors.

The recommended flow is where you follow through the instructions in all
sections in the listed sequence. Alternatively, you may like to cover
section <<walk-through>> through <<jsf>> in an order of your choice, based upon your
interest and preference of the technology. However section <<jaxrs>> is a
pre-requisite for <<json>>.

Here is an approximate time estimate for each section:

[cols="4,2"]
|===
|Section Title |Estimated Time

|<<walk-through>>
|15 - 30 mins

|<<websocket>>
|30 - 45 mins

|<<batch>>
|30 - 45 mins

|<<jaxrs>>
|30 - 45 mins

|<<json>>
|30 - 45 mins

|<<jms>>
|30 - 45 mins

|<<jsf>>
|30 - 45 mins
|===

The listed time for each section is only an estimate and by no means
restrict you within that. These sections have been completed in much
shorter time, and you can do it too!

TIP: The listed time for each section also allows you to create a custom
version of the lab depending upon your target audience and available
time.
